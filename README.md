# Till System
The main basis of the system is just to be used by a business to record any outgoing or incoming data from the business. I have devoloped a user friendly simple UI for the employees to interact with and make use of to record all types of data.

## Setting up Visual Studio:
The users should download the latest Visual Studio app from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/ and after the installer is installed users must run the visual studio installer and install the app with the recommended settings.

## Setting up the App:
After visual studio has been installed the users must download a zip version of the folder and then click on the "Till System.sln" file which would automaticcaly run the game. User must also download the " System Information.accb" file to run the program, the Microsoft Access file includes all of the data required to run the till system

## Starting the program:
The user can create a user profile in the beginning with the "Sign Up" option and then login using the credentials to start using the program.

## Output from the system:
The system will create a text file everytime a transaction is completed and payment has been taken into the till system repository.
